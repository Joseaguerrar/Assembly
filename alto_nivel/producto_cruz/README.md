# Cross Product
    
## Instructions

1. Create a folder in your user's home directory named `producto_cruz`.

## Description

In this exercise, you will implement a function that receives two numbers and calculates their cross product.  
The goal is to practice packed operations using 128-bit or 256-bit registers, so multiple vectors will be passed  
to the function at the same time.

### Run
To run the program, execute the following commands from the program's directory:

```bash
make packed
./code_generated/productoCruzPacked
```

## Input

The program receives a file named vectors.txt with the following structure:

The file has the following format:
```
a1 a2 a3 b1 b2 b3
c1 c2 c3 d1 d2 d3
...
```
